#!/bin/sh
# An example script which can be run when a "screen button" (e.g. Fn+F7 on
# Thinkpads) is pressed to toggle between laptop screen and an external/extended/
# cloned screen. This script detects whether the laptop screen is active (using
# the resolution - make sure this is correct), and switches either to a profile
# called "laptop" or auto-disper's automatic profile. (A profile must be created
# for "laptop" and each external display used by running
#   ./auto-disper --save NAME
# ).

# Path where auto-disper can be found:
AD_PATH=~/sh
